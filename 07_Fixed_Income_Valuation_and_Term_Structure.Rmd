## Summary of Lecture 7 â€“ Fixed Income Valuation and Term Structure

### Learning Objectives
- Understand bond pricing fundamentals and the relationship between bond prices, yield to maturity, and coupon rates.
- Valuation and characteristics of zero-coupon bonds and building the yield curve.
- Valuing coupon-bearing bonds using present value of future cash flows.
- Factors affecting yield curve shape and deriving forward rates from the yield curve.

### Bond Pricing Models

#### Bond Pricing Model I
The price of a bond is the present value of expected cash flows, including coupon and principal. The discount rate is the yield to maturity ($YTM$).

$$
\begin{align}
P_b &= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^T}
\end{align}
$$



$$
\text{Annualities Factor} = \frac{1}{r} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} \right)\
$$

$$
P_B = C_t \times \text{Annuity Factor} + \text{Par} \times \text{PV Factor}\frac{C_t}{r} \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} \right] + \frac{\text{Par}}{(1 + r)^T}
$$

Where:

- $P_b$ = price of the bond
- $C_t$ = coupon payment
- $F$ = face value of the bond
- $T$ = number of periods
- $r$ is the appropriate discount rate, required return by bondholders, or yield to maturity 

```{r}

calculate_present_value <- function(C_t, r, T, Par) {
  annuity_factor <- (1 - 1 / (1 + r)^T) / r
  pv_factor <- 1 / (1 + r)^T
  P_B <- C_t * annuity_factor + Par * pv_factor
  return(P_B)
}

# Example usage
C_t <- 1000
r <- 0.05
T <- 10
Par <- 10000

P_B <- calculate_present_value(C_t, r, T, Par)
P_B
```

#### Bond Pricing Model II

Zero-coupon bonds involve calculating the present value of the par value, discounted by the zero-coupon rate.

$$
\begin{align}
P &= \frac{F}{(1 + z_T)^T}
\end{align}
$$

### Yield Curve
The yield curve plots yields-to-maturity for coupon bonds against their terms to maturity. It's crucial to understand forward rates, zero rates, and actual rates.

#### Forward Rate Calculation
Forward rates can be derived from zero rates to determine arbitrage-free pricing.

$$
\begin{align}
f_{n,n+1} &= \left( \frac{(1 + z_{n+1})^{n+1}}{(1 + z_n)^n} \right) - 1
\end{align}
$$

### Term Structure of Interest Rates (TSIR)
TSIR describes the relationship between interest rates and terms. The yield curve can be influenced by:

1. **Expectations Hypothesis**: Investors' expectations about future interest rates.
2. **Liquidity Preference Theory**: Prefers short-term bonds for liquidity purposes.
3. **Market Segmentation Theory**: Different investors have different preferred investment horizons.
4. **Preferred Habitat Theory**: Investors have preferred investment horizons but will deviate for adequate compensation.

### Valuation of Coupon-Bearing Bonds
To value coupon-bearing bonds, sum the present value of future cash flows (coupons and face value) discounted by the yield to maturity.

$$
\begin{align}
P &= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C}{(1 + YTM)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + YTM)^T}
\end{align}
$$

### Immunization
Immunization strategies balance exposure to interest rate movements and reinvestment risk. Duration matching is a common immunization strategy.

$$
\begin{align}
D &= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{t \cdot PV(C_t)}{P}
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $D$ = duration
- $PV(C_t)$ = present value of coupon at time $t$

### Convexity
Convexity measures the sensitivity of the duration of a bond to changes in interest rates. Bonds with higher convexity are less affected by rate changes.

$$
\begin{align}
Convexity &= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{t (t + 1) \cdot PV(C_t)}{(1 + YTM)^{t+2}}
\end{align}
$$

### Conclusion
Understanding bond pricing, valuation, and the factors affecting the yield curve is crucial for fixed-income investment. Key models include the pricing of zero-coupon and coupon-bearing bonds, the yield curve, term structure theories, and strategies for immunization and duration management.
