Determine the expected return and risk of portfolios combining risky assets and risk-free investments like Treasury bills. Use the Sharpe ratio for evaluating portfolio performance and guiding capital allocation. Understand the role of utility in determining optimal capital allocation to risky assets. 2.2 Measuring Returns Returns can be measured in several ways: Holding Period Return (HPR): This is the return earned over the period an investment is held. Returns Over Multiple Periods: These can be compounded over time using methods such as: arithmetic average, geometric average (compound annual growth rate), and dollar-weighted average (internal rate of return). 2.2.1 Arithmetic Average \\[ \\text{Arithmetic Average} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \\] where \\(r_i\\) is the return in period \\(i\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of periods. 2.2.2 Geometric Average \\[ \\text{Geometric Average} = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{N} (1 + r_i) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}} - 1 \\] where \\(r_i\\) is the return in period \\(i\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of periods. 2.2.3 Dollar-Weighted Average (Internal Rate of Return) The dollar-weighted average return, or internal rate of return (IRR), is the discount rate \\(r\\) that sets the net present value (NPV) = 0. It is calculated by solving the following equation: \\[ \\text{Dollar-Weighted Average} = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} = 0 \\] Where \\(C_t\\) is the net cash flow at time \\(t\\), and \\(N\\) is the total number of periods. # Define the cash flows and times cash_flows &lt;- c(-1000, 200, 300, 400, 500) times &lt;- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) # Define the function for NPV npv_function &lt;- function(r) { sum(cash_flows / (1 + r)^times) } # Use uniroot to find the IRR (dollar-weighted average return) irr &lt;- uniroot(npv_function, c(-1, 1))$root irr ## [1] 0.1282636 2.2.4 Annualizing Returns Annual Percentage Rate (APR): Simple annualized interest rate without compounding. Effective Annual Rate (EAR): Accounts for intra-year compounding, providing a true measure of annual return. \\[ \\text{APR} = r \\times n \\] Where: \\(r\\) is the periodic interest rate \\(n\\) is the number of compounding periods per year \\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n - 1 \\] Where: \\(r\\) is the nominal annual interest rate \\(n\\) is the number of compounding periods per year Example: $ 10000 Deposit, APR (annual percentage rate): 4% p.a. Compounding Quarterly. \\[ \\begin{aligned} EAR &amp;= (1+r/n)^n− 1 \\\\ &amp;=(1+(0.04)/4)^4 −1 \\\\ &amp;=0.0406 \\\\ &amp;= 4.06\\% \\end{aligned} \\] r &lt;- 0.04 # 8% annual nominal interest rate mn &lt;- 4 # Quarterly compounding # Calculate the Effective Annual Rate (EAR) EAR &lt;- (1 + r / mn)^mn - 1 EAR ## [1] 0.04060401 2.3 Risk and Risk Premiums 2.3.1 Expected Return \\(E(R)\\) Is the weighted average of all possible returns, with weights being the probabilities of each scenario. \\[ E(R) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \\cdot r_i \\] Where: \\(E(R)\\) is the expected return of the portfolio \\(p_i\\) is the probability/weight of asset \\(i\\) in the portfolio \\(r_i\\) is the expected return of individual asset \\(i\\) \\(N\\) is the number of assets in the portfolio Example Calculation Asset A: weight = 50%, expected return = 10% Asset B: weight = 30%, expected return = 15% Asset C: weight = 20%, expected return = 20% The expected return of the portfolio is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} E(R) &amp;= (0.50 \\cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \\cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \\cdot 0.20) \\\\ &amp;= 0.05 + 0.045 + 0.04 \\\\ &amp;= 0.135 \\\\ &amp;= 13.5\\% \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] R Code for Calculation # Define the weights and expected returns of the assets weights &lt;- c(0.50, 0.30, 0.20) expected_returns &lt;- c(0.10, 0.15, 0.20) # Calculate the expected return of the portfolio expected_return_portfolio &lt;- sum(weights * expected_returns) # Print the expected return as a percentage expected_return_percentage &lt;- expected_return_portfolio * 100 expected_return_percentage ## [1] 13.5 2.3.2 Standard Deviation Measures the deviation of returns from the mean. \\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(i) [r(i) - E(r)]^2} \\] Where: \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the expected return \\(p(i)\\) is the probability/weight of assets \\(i\\) \\(r(i)\\) is the return of individual assets \\(i\\) \\(E(r)\\) is the expected return \\(N\\) is the number of assets Example Calculation asset 1: probability = 0.3, return = 0.12 asset 2: probability = 0.4, return = 0.04 asset 3: probability = 0.3, return = -0.02 Expected return \\(E(r) = 0.046\\) The standard deviation of the expected return is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\sigma &amp;= \\sqrt{0.3(0.12 - 0.046)^2 + 0.4(0.04 - 0.046)^2 + 0.3(-0.02 - 0.046)^2}\\\\ &amp;= 0.0544\\\\ &amp;= 5.44\\% \\end{aligned} \\] R Code for Calculation # Define the probabilities and returns of the states probabilities &lt;- c(0.3, 0.4, 0.3) returns &lt;- c(0.12, 0.04, -0.02) expected_return &lt;- 0.046 # Calculate the variance variance &lt;- sum(probabilities * (returns - expected_return)^2) # Calculate the standard deviation standard_deviation &lt;- sqrt(variance) # Print the standard deviation as a percentage standard_deviation_percentage &lt;- standard_deviation * 100 standard_deviation_percentage ## [1] 5.444263 2.3.3 Normal Distribution Stock returns are often assumed to be normally distributed. However, real return distributions may show skewness such as “fat tails.” \\[X∼N(μ,σ2)\\] \\[ f(x | \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\] Where: \\(\\mu\\) is the mean \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation \\(x\\) is the variable standard normal distribution is the normal distribution with mean \\(μ\\) = 0 and standard deviation \\(σ\\) = 1. \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) \\] Where: \\(\\mu = 0\\) \\(\\sigma = 1\\) \\(x\\) is the variable Example Calculation Let’s calculate the probability of a value \\(x\\) in a normal distribution with a mean \\(\\mu = 0\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 1\\) (standard normal distribution).

They demand a risk premium for taking additional risk, quantified by the price of risk (ratio of risk premium to variance). Risk-averse investors reject investment opportunities with a risk premium of zero or less. Degree of risk aversion \\[ A = \\frac{E(r_i) - E(r_f)}{\\sigma_i^2} \\] Where: \\(A\\) = degree of risk aversion \\(E(r_i)\\) is the expected return of the risky asset. \\(E(r_f)\\) is the risk-free rate. \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) is the variance of the return of the risky asset. Example For the market portfolio (e.g., S&amp;P 500 index funds), the average degree of risk aversion of investors is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\bar{A} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Average}(r_M - r_f)}{\\text{Sample } \\sigma_M^2}\\\\ &amp;\\approx \\frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2 \\end{aligned} \\] Where: \\(r_M\\) is the return of the market portfolio. \\(\\sigma_M^2\\) is the variance of the market return. 2.4 Portfolio Construction Selection of risky assets/portfolios such as stocks and bonds. Decision on the proportion of the portfolio to invest in risky assets versus risk-free assets. 2.4.1 Capital Allocation: Combining investments in risk-free and risky assets allows for varying expected returns and risks. We call the overall portfolio composed of the risk-free asset and the risky portfolio the complete portfolio. 2.4.2 Utility Utility: Represents investor preferences, considering risk aversion. It helps in making decisions about different securities.This is a single measure we have the investor’s attitudes to risk and return at each level of wealth. Influence of the trade-off decisions: Risk appetite (strong financial position and stable income may have higher appitite) proportion of the investor’s total wealth. (psychological risk aversion) Financial Goals/liquidity needs (set when they need cash flow) Investment Horizon (longer horizon takes more risk) Knowledge and Experience (Dunning Kruger effect) Social/Regulatory environment and incentives 2.4.3 Utility Function Captures an investor’s risk-return trade-offs. Utility increases with expected return and decreases with risk. More risk-averse investors have higher coefficients of risk aversion (A). There are countless utility functions. An example is: \\[ U = E(r) - \\frac{1}{2} A \\sigma^2 \\] Where: \\(U\\) = the utility value, \\(A\\) = coefficient of risk aversion, \\(\\sigma^2\\) = variance Utility increases with expected returns and decreases with risk. Utility of a risk-free portfolio is equal to its rate of return. More risk-averse investors will have larger values of A. Investors assign higher utility to more attractive risk-return portfolios. Example: where: \\(A\\) degree of risk aversion = \\(2\\) \\(r_f\\) risk-free rate = \\(4\\%\\) # Define the expected return, variance, and coefficient of risk aversion risk_free_rate = 0.04 expected_return &lt;- 0.08 # Expected return (E(r)) variance &lt;- 0.06^2 # Variance (σ^2) A &lt;- 2 # Coefficient of risk aversion (A) # Calculate the utility value (U) utility &lt;- expected_return - (1/2) * A * variance utility ## [1] 0.0764 2.4.4 Indifference Curves These curves connect portfolios providing the same utility level, illustrating an investor’s preference for different risk-return combinations.

Borrowing at the risk-free rate extends the CAL. Borrowing rates higher than the risk-free rate cause a kink in the CAL, changing the slope. \\[ \\begin{aligned} (r_c) &amp;= (−0.5)∗0.09+(1.5)∗0.15\\\\ &amp;=18\\% \\\\ \\sigma_c &amp;= (1.5)0.22 = 33\\% \\\\ \\text{The Sharpe ratio is} \\\\ (18−9)/0.33 &amp;= 0.27\\% \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 2.4.7 Utility Maximization In portfolio theory, investors aim to maximize their utility, which balances expected return and risk. Mathematically, the utility function is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Max}(U) &amp;= E(r) - \\frac{1}{2} A \\sigma^2 \\\\ &amp;= r_f + y [E(r_p) - r_f] - \\frac{1}{2} A y^2 \\sigma_p^2 \\\\ \\text{Solve for y, we have } \\\\ y &amp;= \\frac{E(r_p) - r_f}{A \\sigma_p^2} \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(U\\): Utility value. \\(E(r)\\): Expected return. \\(A\\): Coefficient of risk aversion. \\(\\sigma^2\\): Variance (of returns). \\(r_f\\): Risk-free rate. \\(y\\): Allocation proportion or weight in the risky portfolio. \\(E(r_p)\\): Expected return of the risky portfolio. \\(\\sigma_p^2\\): Variance (of returns) of the risky portfolio. To find the optimal proportion \\(y\\) to invest in the risky portfolio, we solve for \\(y\\): R code # Define parameters rf &lt;- 0.06 # Risk-free rate Erp &lt;- 0.18 # Expected return of the risky portfolio sigma_p &lt;- 0.25 # Standard deviation of the risky portfolio A &lt;- 5 # Degree of risk aversion # Calculate optimal y y &lt;- (Erp - rf) / (A * sigma_p^2) y ## [1] 0.384 # The Expected Return ER = rf + (y*(Erp - rf)) ER ## [1] 0.10608 sigma_c = y*sigma_p sigma_c ## [1] 0.096 sharpe = (ER- rf)/sigma_c sharpe ## [1] 0.48 2.4.8 Personal preferences Investors aim to choose portfolios on higher indifference curves. Higher indifference curves provide a higher expected return for a given level of risk. More risk-averse investors have steeper indifference curves. More risk-averse investors require a greater increase in expected return for an increase in portfolio risk. 2.4.9 The Capital Market Line (CML) Aspect Active Management Passive Management Pros Higher Return Potential Aims to outperform the market.
