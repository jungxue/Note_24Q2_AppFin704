Speculative Hedging Arbitraging (to lock in price) Arbitrage describes the act of buying a security in one market and simultaneously selling it in another market at a higher price, thereby enabling investors to profit from the temporary difference in cost per share. 1.2 Securities Markets and Trading Originators Publicly traded companies initial public offering (IPO), and seasonal equity offerings (SEOs), - Privately held firms (private placement in which shares are sold directly to a small group of institutional or wealthy investors) Shelf registrations (public firms can register securities and gradually sell them to the public ) How securities are traded (in secondary markets) Direct search (e.g. painting) Brokered Dealer Auctions ype of orders maket order price contingeant order Trading mechanisms OTC dealer electronic market maker (increase liquidity) – Over the counter dealer markets (OTC Markets) - Electronic communication networks ( ECNs) margin trading why to purchase with margin? able to make more profits by borrowing money from broker, essentially multiplying market fluctuation/volatility. short sale (borrow stocks to sell and payback when you sold it at profit) derivative market (sell, not borrowing) 1.3 Market Participants 1.3.1 Investment company Intermediary that invest for investors Record and admin professional management Lower transaction cost by volume Net Asset Value (NAV) \\[\\frac{Asset - Liabilities}{share outstanding}\\] unit investement fund (unmanaged) fixed portfolio for life Managed Investment companies - open-end(publicly trader and closed ended) - close end funds shares sold at discount for liquidity (to sell quickly) Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Can be continuously traded like stocks Other Comingled Funds, Real Estate Investment Trusts, Hedged Funds Mutual Funds 65% of market Money market equity funds (income vs growth) specialised bond index funds Funds of Funds Funds can be sold directly, indirectly and through financial supermarkets Fee structure Operating expense front end load back end load 12b-1 charges annual fee fro marketing and distribution fee structure is very important and made large apart of your profit share Taxation no tax at fund level long term capital gain tax rate high turnover rate ETF - Passive investement, track index - lower cost - smart beta fund Bid ask spread (depend on demand) Index price depart from NAV mutual fund underperformed passive funds(cost of high freq trading) consistent performance, don’t be obsessed with top performer, they could be winner by chance "],["ch2.html", "Lecture 2 Risk and Return 2.1 Learning Objectives 2.2 Measuring Returns 2.3 Risk and Risk Premiums 2.4 Portfolio Construction", " Lecture 2 Risk and Return 2.1 Learning Objectives This lecture aims to provide the ability to: Compute various measures of return on multi-year investments. Determine the expected return and risk of portfolios combining risky assets and risk-free investments like Treasury bills. Use the Sharpe ratio for evaluating portfolio performance and guiding capital allocation. Understand the role of utility in determining optimal capital allocation to risky assets. 2.2 Measuring Returns Returns can be measured in several ways: Holding Period Return (HPR): This is the return earned over the period an investment is held. Returns Over Multiple Periods: These can be compounded over time using methods such as: arithmetic average, geometric average (compound annual growth rate), and dollar-weighted average (internal rate of return). 2.2.1 Arithmetic Average \\[ \\text{Arithmetic Average} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \\] where \\(r_i\\) is the return in period \\(i\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of periods. 2.2.2 Geometric Average \\[ \\text{Geometric Average} = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{N} (1 + r_i) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}} - 1 \\] where \\(r_i\\) is the return in period \\(i\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of periods. 2.2.3 Dollar-Weighted Average (Internal Rate of Return) The dollar-weighted average return, or internal rate of return (IRR), is the discount rate \\(r\\) that sets the net present value (NPV) = 0. It is calculated by solving the following equation: \\[ \\text{Dollar-Weighted Average} = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} = 0 \\] Where \\(C_t\\) is the net cash flow at time \\(t\\), and \\(N\\) is the total number of periods. 2.2.4 Annualizing Returns Annual Percentage Rate (APR): Simple annualized interest rate without compounding. Effective Annual Rate (EAR): Accounts for intra-year compounding, providing a true measure of annual return. \\[ \\text{APR} = r \\times n \\] Where: \\(r\\) is the periodic interest rate \\(n\\) is the number of compounding periods per year \\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n - 1 \\] Where: \\(r\\) is the nominal annual interest rate \\(n\\) is the number of compounding periods per year Example: $ 10000 Deposit, APR (annual percentage rate): 4% p.a.

They demand a risk premium for taking additional risk, quantified by the price of risk (ratio of risk premium to variance). Risk-averse investors reject investment opportunities with a risk premium of zero or less. Degree of risk aversion \\[ A = \\frac{E(r_i) - E(r_f)}{\\sigma_i^2} \\] Where: \\(A\\) = degree of risk aversion \\(E(r_i)\\) is the expected return of the risky asset. \\(E(r_f)\\) is the risk-free rate. \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) is the variance of the return of the risky asset. Example For the market portfolio (e.g., S&amp;P 500 index funds), the average degree of risk aversion of investors is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\bar{A} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Average}(r_M - r_f)}{\\text{Sample } \\sigma_M^2}\\\\ &amp;\\approx \\frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2 \\end{aligned} \\] Where: \\(r_M\\) is the return of the market portfolio. \\(\\sigma_M^2\\) is the variance of the market return. 2.4 Portfolio Construction Selection of risky assets/portfolios such as stocks and bonds. Decision on the proportion of the portfolio to invest in risky assets versus risk-free assets. 2.4.1 Capital Allocation: Combining investments in risk-free and risky assets allows for varying expected returns and risks. We call the overall portfolio composed of the risk-free asset and the risky portfolio the complete portfolio. 2.4.2 Utility Utility: Represents investor preferences, considering risk aversion. It helps in making decisions about different securities.This is a single measure we have the investor’s attitudes to risk and return at each level of wealth. Influence of the trade-off decisions: Risk appetite (strong financial position and stable income may have higher appitite) proportion of the investor’s total wealth. (psychological risk aversion) Financial Goals/liquidity needs (set when they need cash flow) Investment Horizon (longer horizon takes more risk) Knowledge and Experience (Dunning Kruger effect) Social/Regulatory environment and incentives 2.4.3 Utility Function Captures an investor’s risk-return trade-offs. Utility increases with expected return and decreases with risk. More risk-averse investors have higher coefficients of risk aversion (A). There are countless utility functions. An example is: \\[ U = E(r) - \\frac{1}{2} A \\sigma^2 \\] Where: \\(U\\) = the utility value, \\(A\\) = coefficient of risk aversion, \\(\\sigma^2\\) = variance Utility increases with expected returns and decreases with risk. Utility of a risk-free portfolio is equal to its rate of return. More risk-averse investors will have larger values of A. Investors assign higher utility to more attractive risk-return portfolios. Example: where: \\(A\\) degree of risk aversion = \\(2\\) \\(r_f\\) risk-free rate = \\(4\\%\\) 2.4.4 Indifference Curves These curves connect portfolios providing the same utility level, illustrating an investor’s preference for different risk-return combinations. Simply above the curve Yes, below the curve no. 2.4.5 Capital Allocation Line It’s possible to split investment funds between safe and risky assets. Risk free asset: proxy = T-bills Risky asset: stock (or a portfolio) \\(r_f\\) Risk-free rate = \\(7\\%\\) \\(\\sigma_{r_f}\\) Standard deviation of the risk-free rate = \\(0\\) \\(E(r_p)\\) Expected return of the risky portfolio = \\(15\\%\\) \\(\\sigma_p\\) Standard deviation of the risky portfolio = \\(22\\%\\) The investor allocates \\(y\\) proportion of their wealth in the risky portfolio and \\(1 - y\\) in the risk-free portfolio. \\[ \\begin{aligned} E(r_c) &amp;= (y)E(r_p) + (1 - y)r_f \\\\ E(r_c) &amp;= y \\times 15\\% + (1 - y) \\times 7\\% \\\\ E(r_c) &amp;= 7\\% + y \\times (15\\% - 7\\%) \\\\ E(r_c) &amp;= 7\\% + 8y \\\\ and \\\\ \\sigma_c &amp;= y \\sigma_=22\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Example: \\[ \\begin{aligned} y &amp;= 0.75 \\\\ r_ &amp;= 0.07+0.08*(0.75) = 13\\% \\\\ \\sigma_c &amp;= y \\sigma_=22\\\\ \\sigma_c &amp;= 16.5\\% \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The Sharpe Ratio, which measures extra return per unit of risk (gradient of line), is calculated as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Sharpe ratio} &amp;= \\frac{E(r_p) - r_f}{ \\sigma_p}\\\\ &amp;= 8/22 \\\\ &amp;= 0.36\\%. \\end{aligned} \\] 2.4.6 Capital Allocation Line (CAL) with Leverage Leverage multiplies loss and return at a cost of borrowing money from dealers. Borrowing at the risk-free rate extends the CAL. Borrowing rates higher than the risk-free rate cause a kink in the CAL, changing the slope. \\[ \\begin{aligned} (r_c) &amp;= (−0.5)∗0.09+(1.5)∗0.15\\\\ &amp;=18\\% \\\\ \\sigma_c &amp;= (1.5)0.22 = 33\\% \\\\ \\text{The Sharpe ratio is} \\\\ (18−9)/0.33 &amp;= 0.27\\% \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 2.4.7 Utility Maximization In portfolio theory, investors aim to maximize their utility, which balances expected return and risk. Mathematically, the utility function is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Max}(U) &amp;= E(r) - \\frac{1}{2} A \\sigma^2 \\\\ &amp;= r_f + y [E(r_p) - r_f] - \\frac{1}{2} A y^2 \\sigma_p^2 \\\\ \\text{Solve for y, we have } \\\\ y^* &amp;= \\frac{E(r_p) - r_f}{A \\sigma_p^2} \\end{aligned} \\] To find the optimal proportion \\(y^\\) to invest in the risky portfolio, we solve for \\(y_*\\): R code # Define parameters rf &lt;- 0.06 # Risk-free rate Erp &lt;- 0.18 # Expected return of the risky portfolio sigma_p &lt;- 0.25 # Standard deviation of the risky portfolio A &lt;- 5 # Degree of risk aversion # Calculate optimal y y_star &lt;- (Erp - rf) / (A * sigma_p^2) y_star ## [1] 0.384 # The Expected Return ER = rf + (y_star*(Erp - rf)) ER ## [1] 0.10608 sigma_c = y_star*sigma_p sigma_c ## [1] 0.096 sharpe = (ER- rf)/sigma_c sharpe ## [1] 0.48 2.4.8 Personal preferences Investors aim to choose portfolios on higher indifference curves. Higher indifference curves provide a higher expected return for a given level of risk. More risk-averse investors have steeper indifference curves. More risk-averse investors require a greater increase in expected return for an increase in portfolio risk. 2.4.9 The Capital Market Line (CML) Aspect Active Management Passive Management Pros Higher Return Potential Aims to outperform the market. Matches market returns. Flexibility Can quickly adjust to market changes. Follows index rules. Risk Management Can avoid certain sectors or stocks to manage risk. Diversified holdings reduce specific risks. Exploiting Inefficiencies Can capitalize on market inefficiencies. Benefits from overall market growth. Customization Tailors strategy to investor goals. Simple, straightforward strategy. Cons Higher Costs More fees and expenses due to frequent trading and research. Lower fees and expenses. Performance Uncertainty No guarantee of outperforming the market. Predictable performance, matches index. Increased Risk Higher risk from concentrated positions and market timing. Lower risk due to diversification. Tax Implications More frequent trading can lead to higher taxes. Less frequent trading, more tax efficient. Dependence on Manager Skill Relies on the skill and judgment of the manager. No reliance on manager skill.

Sector Risk Specific sectors or industries under-performing. Company Risk Individual companies facing financial difficulties or poor performance. Liquidity Risk Difficulty in buying or selling assets without significant price changes. Currency Risk Exchange rate fluctuations impacting international investments. Interest Rate Risk Changes in interest rates affecting bond prices and portfolio value. Political Risk Political events or policy changes impacting financial markets. Regulatory Risk Changes in regulations affecting industries or companies in the portfolio. Market risk (systematic risk): non-diversifiable risk Unique risk (non-systematic risk): firm-specific risk, diversifiable risk 3.2 Portfolio Calculations 3.2.1 Expected return The expected return of the portfolio is \\[ E(r_P) = w_1 E(r_1) + w_2 E(r_2) \\] Where: \\(E(r_P)\\)is the expected return of the portfolio. \\(w_1\\) is the weight of asset 1 in the portfolio. \\(E(r_1)\\) is the expected return of asset 1. \\(w_2\\) is the weight of asset 2 in the portfolio. \\(E(r_2)\\) is the expected return of asset 2. 3.2.2 variance Variance measures how much the values of a random variable vary or spread out from the mean (average) The variance of the portfolio \\(\\sigma_P^2\\) can be calculated using the following formula: \\[ \\sigma_P^2 = w_1^2 \\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1 w_2 \\rho_{12} \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\] Where: \\(\\sigma_P^2\\) is the variance of the portfolio. \\(w_1\\) is the weight of asset 1 in the portfolio. \\(\\sigma_1^2\\) is the variance of returns of asset 1. $w_2 $ is the weight of asset 2 in the portfolio. \\(\\sigma_2^2\\) is the variance of returns of asset 2. \\(\\rho_{12}\\) is the correlation coefficient between returns of assets 1 and 2. \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are the standard deviations of returns of assets 1 and 2, respectively. The variance formula accounts for the individual variances of assets 1 and 2, as well as their covariance. \\[Cov(r_1,r_2 )=\\rho_{12} _1 _2\\] 3.2.2.1 Case I: $ = 1 $ When the correlation coefficient is 1, the formula simplifies to: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\sigma_P^2 &amp;= (w_1 \\sigma_1 + w_2 \\sigma_2)^2 \\\\ \\sigma_P &amp;= w_1 \\sigma_1 + w_2 \\sigma_2 \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 3.2.2.2 Case II: $ = -1 $ When the correlation coefficient is -1, the formula simplifies to: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\sigma_P^2 &amp;= (w_1 \\sigma_1 - w_2 \\sigma_2)^2 \\\\ \\sigma_P &amp;= w_1 \\sigma_1 - w_2 \\sigma_2 \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 3.2.3 Covariance The covariance between returns of assets A and B (\\(Cov(r_A, r_B)\\)) can be calculated using the following formula: \\[Cov(r_A, r_B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(i)[r_A(i) - E(r_A)][r_B(i) - E(r_B)]\\] Where: \\(Cov(r_A, r_B)\\) is the covariance between returns of assets A and B. \\(p(i)\\) is the probability of scenario \\(i\\). \\(r_A(i)\\) and \\(r_B(i)\\) are the returns of assets A and B, respectively, in scenario \\(i\\). \\(E(r_A)\\) and \\(E(r_B)\\) are the expected returns of assets A and B, respectively. R code returns_A &lt;- c(0.05, 0.03, 0.02, 0.06, 0.04) # Returns for asset A returns_B &lt;- c(0.04, 0.02, 0.01, 0.05, 0.03) # Returns for asset B # Expected returns of assets A and B E_r_A &lt;- mean(returns_A) E_r_B &lt;- mean(returns_B) # Probabilities of scenarios probabilities &lt;- c(0.2, 0.15, 0.25, 0.1, 0.3) # Calculation of covariance covariance &lt;- sum(probabilities * (returns_A - E_r_A) * (returns_B - E_r_B)) # Print the covariance print(paste(&quot;Covariance between returns of assets A and B:&quot;, covariance)) ## [1] &quot;Covariance between returns of assets A and B: 0.000175&quot; 3.2.4 Correlation \\[{\\rho_12} = \\frac{Cov(r_1,r_2 )}{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}\\] The portfolio return is not affected by correlation between returns Thus, investors should always prefer to add to their portfolios assets with low or negative correlation to diversify risks.

The analytical technique to derive efficient frontier was developed by Harry Markowitz, and is often referred to as the Markowitz Model 3.3.4 Separation Property Separation property states that the asset allocation problem can be divided into two independent steps: Determination of the optimal risky portfolio: this portfolio will be same for all clients. Determination of the complete portfolio that also includes the risk-free asset. Thus, fund managers can serve many customers by only offering at least one portfolio.

Construct and use the security market line (SML). Specify and use a multifactor SML. Use Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) with multiple factors to identify mis-priced securities. 4.1 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) The Markowitz portfolio selection model assumes all investors are rational, i.e., mean-variance optimizers. CAPM assumes: Individual investors are price takers. All investors have a single-period planning horizon. No taxes or transaction costs. Information is costless and available to all investors. Investors interpret information identically. 4.1.1 CAPM Equation The market portfolio defines the optimal Capital Allocation Line (CAL). In theory everyone tries to reach it. Risk premium on the market portfolio is proportional to its risk and average risk aversion. \\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) \\] where: \\(E(R_i)\\) = expected return of investment \\(R_f\\) = risk-free rate \\(\\beta_i\\) = beta of the investment \\(E(R_m) - R_f\\) = market risk premium Investors expect to be compensated for the risk and the time value of money. For example, in NZ, BKMB is the risk free rate(note it is technically not) and additional basis point on top is the premium. \\[ E(r_M) - r_f = \\bar{A} \\sigma_M^2 \\] \\[ E(r_i) - r_f = \\beta_i [E(r_M) - r_f] \\] Here, \\(\\bar{A}\\) is the average level of risk aversion across investors (weighted average, by wealth). and \\[ \\beta_i = \\frac{\\text{cov}(r_i, r_M)}{\\sigma_M^2} = \\frac{\\rho_{i,M} \\sigma_i}{\\sigma_M} \\] The CAPM calculates the expected return of an investment by adding the risk-free rate to the beta-adjusted market risk premium, where beta measures the investment’s sensitivity to market risk and alpha represents the excess return not explained by beta. 4.1.2 Security Market Line (SML) Graphs individual asset risk premiums as a function of asset risk (beta). Provides a benchmark for evaluating portfolio performance. 4.1.3 CAPM Implementation Risk-free rate: Use short-term treasury securities. Beta: Covariance of stock and market returns divided by market variance. Market portfolio: Use a broad market index return. 4.1.4 Violations and Limitations of the CAPM Empirical tests show a weaker relation between beta and returns. Market capitalization and book-to-market ratios predict returns better than beta. Other anomalies include momentum effects. 4.1.5 Multifactor Models Allow for multiple systematic risk factors (e.g., GDP, inflation). Estimate a beta for each factor using multiple regression. Example: Fama-French Three-Factor Model Factors: Market risk, firm size, and book-to-market ratio. \\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_{iM} (E(R_M) - R_f) + \\beta_{iS} (E(SMB)) + \\beta_{iH} (E(HML)) \\] \\(\\beta_{iM}\\), \\(\\beta_{iS}\\), and \\(\\beta_{iH}\\) are the betas for the market, size, and value factors. 4.2 Comparison of CML and SML Feature Security Market Line (SML) Capital Market Line (CML) Definition Relationship between expected return and beta (systematic risk) Risk-return trade-off for efficient portfolios Equation \\(E(r_i) = r_f + \\beta_i (E(r_M) - r_f)\\) \\(E(r_P) = r_f + \\frac{E(r_M) - r_f}{\\sigma_M} \\sigma_P\\) Risk Measure Beta (systematic risk) Standard deviation (total risk) Applicability Individual securities Efficient portfolios Correct Pricing Securities lie on the SML Portfolios lie on the CML Slope Market risk premium \\((E(r_M) - r_f)\\) Sharpe ratio of the market \\(\\left(\\frac{E(r_M) - r_f}{\\sigma_M}\\right)\\) 4.3 Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) If two portfolios are mispriced, the investor could short the high-priced portfolio and buy the low-priced portfolio. Arbitrage opportunities last for very short periods . 4.3.1 Assumptions Returns can be described by a factor model. No arbitrage opportunities. Large number of securities to form diversified portfolios. Like the CAPM, the APT also uses an SML for expected return and risk 4.3.2 Key Concepts Systematic (factor) risk remains in diversified portfolios. Risk premium depends only on systematic risk. 4.3.3 APT Model Portfolio A Portfolio A is a well-diversified portfolio with a beta (\\(\\beta_P\\)) of 0.7. Its excess return equation is: \\[ \\begin{align} r_P - r_f &amp;= \\alpha_P + \\beta_P (r_M - r_f) \\\\ &amp;= \\alpha_P + 0.7(r_M - r_f) \\end{align} \\] Portfolio B Portfolio B includes the market index and T-bills with weights of 0.7 and 0.3 respectively. Its return equation is: \\[ \\begin{align} r_p &amp;= 0.3r_f + 0.7r_M \\\\ &amp;= r_f + 0.7(r_M - r_f) \\end{align} \\] By shorting $1 of Portfolio A and buying $1 of Portfolio B, you create a zero investment, zero beta portfolio.

Stalwarts: Consistent and reliable performance but usually offer moderate returns. Fast Growers: Characterized by rapid growth and high potential returns, these companies also carry higher risks. Cyclicals: Companies whose performance is tied closely to economic cycles. Turnarounds: These are companies that are currently performing poorly but have the potential for recovery.

P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio) - Ideal for companies with significant tangible assets, like manufacturing or real estate firms. - Compares a company’s market price per share to its book value per share. - Book value is the net asset value of the company calculated as total assets minus total liabilities. P/S Ratio (Price-to-Sales Ratio) - Suited for high-growth companies with low or negative earnings, such as start-ups or firms in industries where profitability is not immediate. - Compares a company’s market capitalization to its total sales revenue. - Indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales generated by the company. 5.2.3 P/E Ratio Factor Influence on P/E Ratio Industry/Sector Different industries have varying profitability and growth prospects. Earnings Growth High growth typically leads to higher P/E ratios. Risk Perception Higher risk can result in lower P/E ratios. Interest Rates Low rates often lead to higher P/E ratios. Market Sentiment Bullish sentiment can inflate P/E ratios, vice versa. Company Size Larger companies may have higher P/E ratios. Dividend Policy Regular dividends may lower P/E ratios. Accounting Method Different methods can affect reported earnings and hence P/E ratios. 5.2.4 Dividend Discount Model (DDM) The DDM estimates a stock’s fair value by summing the present value of its future dividends. If the DDM value exceeds the current stock price, it suggests the stock is undervalued; if it’s lower, it may be overvalued. The Generalized Dividend Discount Model (DDM) calculates the present value of all future dividends, incorporating the discount rate and growth rate. \\[ \\begin{align*} V_0 &amp;= \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\frac{E(CF_t)}{(1+R_t)^t} \\\\ V_0 &amp;= \\frac{D_1}{1+k} + \\frac{D_2}{(1+k)^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{D_H + P_H}{(1+k)^H} \\end{align*} \\] In perpetuity, it simplifies to: \\[ \\begin{align*} V_0 &amp;= \\frac{D_1}{1+k} + \\frac{D_2}{(1+k)^2} + \\frac{D_3}{(1+k)^3} + \\ldots \\\\ V_0 &amp;= \\frac{D_1}{k} \\end{align*} \\] If dividends are growing at a constant rate \\(g\\) forever, we have the Constant Growth Dividend Discount Model: \\[ \\begin{align*} V_0 &amp;= \\frac{D_0 (1+g)}{1+k} + \\frac{D_0 (1+g)^2}{(1+k)^2} + \\frac{D_0 (1+g)^3}{(1+k)^3} + \\ldots \\\\ V_0 &amp;= \\frac{D_1}{k-g} \\end{align*} \\] Where: \\(V_0\\): Present value of the stock or asset. \\(E(CF_t)\\): Expected cash flow at time \\(t\\), which could represent dividends, earnings, or other cash flows. \\(R_t\\): Discount rate at time \\(t\\), often representing the required rate of return or cost of capital. \\(k\\): Discount rate or required rate of return. \\(D_t\\): Dividend at time \\(t\\). \\(P_H\\): Terminal value or price at the horizon year \\(H\\). \\(g\\): Growth rate of dividends. 5.2.5 Constant Growth DDM The constant-growth Dividend Discount Model (DDM) implies that the stock price is expected to grow at the same rate as dividends. To see this: \\[ \\begin{align*} P_1 &amp;= \\frac{D_2}{k - g} = \\frac{D_1 (1 + g)}{k - g} = \\frac{D_1}{k - g} (1 + g) \\\\ P_1 &amp;= P_0 (1 + g) \\end{align*} \\] Thus, for a stock whose market value equals intrinsic value, the expected holding period return will be: \\[ \\begin{align*} E(r) &amp;= \\text{Dividend Yield} + \\text{Capital Gain Yield} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + \\frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0} \\\\ E(r) &amp;= \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + g \\end{align*} \\] Note: we can have Various growth pattern assumptions for dividends 5.2.6 Divident stocks Consideration Description Preference for High Dividends - Some investors prefer stocks with high dividends for regular income and stability. - Dividends can be attractive in volatile markets or during low-interest-rate periods. Dividend Trap - High dividend yield may signal a dividend trap if it’s unsustainable due to declining earnings or cash flow. - Investing in such companies could lead to capital loss if dividends are cut. Value Destruction - Companies paying high dividends without reinvesting in growth may lead to long-term value destruction. - High dividends to support an overvalued stock could hinder future growth and harm shareholder value. 5.2.7 future earnings DDM Rather than the earlier dividend focus, concentrates the analyst’s attention on the core business determinants of value Dividends = earnings - net new investment, i.e., “\\(D = E - I\\)”. \\[ \\begin{align} p_0 = \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{D_t}{(1+k)^t} = \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{E_t}{(1+k)^t} - \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{I_t}{(1+k)^t} \\end{align} \\] where: \\(p_0\\): Present value of the security \\(D_t\\): Dividends at time \\(t\\) \\(E_t\\): Earnings at time \\(t\\) \\(I_t\\): Investments at time \\(t\\) \\(k\\): Discount rate 5.2.8 # Stock Valuation Scenarios No Growth Scenario: If all annual earnings are distributed and there is no growth \\[ P_0 = \\frac{E_1}{k} \\] Growth Opportunities Scenario: If we consider the present value of growth opportunities (PVGO or NPVGO), the stock price is given by: \\[ P_0 = \\frac{E_1}{k} + \\text{NPVGO} \\] Constant Growth Scenario: Assuming a constant retention ratio \\(b\\) and a constant growth rate \\(g\\), the stock price can be expressed as: \\[ P_0 = \\frac{E_1 (1 - b)}{k - g} = \\frac{D_1}{k - g} \\] Where: - \\(P_0\\): Current stock price. - \\(E_1\\): Earnings at time 1. - \\(k\\): Discount rate or required rate of return. - \\(\\text{NPVGO}\\): Net present value of growth opportunities. - \\(b\\): Retention ratio (portion of earnings retained in the company). \\(g = b*ROE\\). - \\(g\\): Growth rate of dividends. - \\(D_1\\): Dividend at time 1 (which is \\(E_1 (1 - b)\\)). 5.2.9 Sources of Value Creation Growth stock Co. initially has the same earnings of $15 as No growth Co., but reinvests 60% of its earnings each year into new investments that yield a real rate of return of 20% per year. \\[ \\text{PV} = \\frac{E_1}{k} = \\frac{\\$15}{0.15} = \\$100 \\] \\[ \\text{PVGO} = \\frac{E_1 (1 - b)}{k - g} = \\frac{\\$15 (1 - 0.60)}{0.15 - 0.60 \\times 0.20} = \\$200 \\] However, \\(g\\) growth rate of dividend cannot be higher than \\(k\\) required rate of return or equation does not work.

Unlike equity securities, shareholders hold “residual claims” on a firm’s assets. 6.1.2 Involvement Issuers Different levels of governments entity Financial intermediaries Corporations Investors Financial intermediaries Investment funds Superannuation funds Corporations Individuals Others Credit Rating Agencies: S&amp;P, Moody’s, Fitch Regulators: ASIC, APRA, SEC 6.2 Bond Types Bond Type Description Fixed-Coupon Bonds Regular interest payments and repayment of principal at maturity. Indexed Bonds Par value and coupon payments are tied to a price index, such as CPI. Floating Rate Bonds Coupon payments vary with short-term interest rates. Convertible Bonds Can be converted into a predetermined number of shares. Callable and Puttable Bonds Callable: Issuer can repay early. Puttable: Holder can demand early repayment. Zero-Coupon Bonds and Others Only pay the face value at maturity. Examples include Treasury Bills. Inflation-Protected Bonds Adjusted for inflation to protect investors from inflation risk. Example: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). 6.2.1 Bond Prices Between payment dates, interest accrues daily on the bond \\[ \\text{Accrued Interest} = \\text{Coupon} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Days since last coupon payment}}{\\text{Days between coupon payments}} \\right) \\] The invoice price is the fair value of the bond by taking the present value of all future cash flows (clean price (or quoted price) + accrued interest) 6.3 Bond Yield Equations 6.3.1 Current Yield \\[ Current\\ Yield = \\frac{Annual\\ Coupon\\ Payment}{Current\\ Market\\ Price} \\] 6.3.2 Yield to Maturity (YTM) YTM is the internal rate of return (IRR) of the bond, considering all coupon payments and the face value repayment at maturity. It can also be interpreted as the compound rate of return over the life of the bond, assuming all coupons are reinvested at YTM \\[ P = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C}{(1+YTM)^t} + \\frac{F}{(1+YTM)^n} \\] Where: \\(P\\) = Current market price \\(C\\) = Annual coupon payment \\(F\\) = Face value of the bond \\(n\\) = Number of years to maturity 6.3.3 Yield to Call (YTC) If a bond is callable, the YTC is calculated similarly to YTM but considers the call date and call price. \\[ P = \\sum_{t=1}^{t_c} \\frac{C}{(1+YTC)^t} + \\frac{C_p}{(1+YTC)^{t_c}} \\] Where: \\(t_c\\) = Call date \\(C_p\\) = Call price 6.4 Realized Compound Return To find the realized compound return \\(r\\) for investment A: \\[ 1{,}000(1+r)^2 = 1{,}210 \\] Solving for \\(r\\): \\[ r = \\left(\\frac{1{,}210}{1{,}000}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} - 1 = 0.10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 10\\% \\] # Variables initial_investment &lt;- 1000 final_value &lt;- 1210 n &lt;- 2 # Calculate and print the realized compound return r &lt;- (final_value / initial_investment)^(1 / n) - 1 round(r * 100, 4) ## [1] 10 6.4.1 Yield Spread Yield spread is the difference in yields between two different bonds, often a corporate bond and a government bond. \\[ Yield\\ Spread = Yield\\ of\\ Corporate\\ Bond - Yield\\ of\\ Government\\ Bond \\] 6.4.2 Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) \\(BEY = \\frac{2 \\cdot (FV - P)}{P \\cdot (T)}\\) Where: - \\(FV\\) = Face value - \\(P\\) = Purchase price - \\(T\\) = Time to maturity in years 6.4.3 Effective Annual Yield (EAY) \\[EAY = \\left(1 + \\frac{YTM}{n}\\right)^n - 1\\] Where: - \\(YTM\\) = Yield to maturity - \\(n\\) = Number of compounding periods per year 6.4.4 Discount Yield Often used for Treasury bills. \\[Discount\\ Yield = \\frac{(F - P)}{F} \\cdot \\frac{360}{Days\\ to\\ Maturity}\\] Where: - \\(F\\) = Face value - \\(P\\) = Purchase price - \\(Days\\ to\\ Maturity\\) = Number of days until maturity 6.5 Bond Pricing Dynamics 6.5.1 Prices Over Time assuming the price will shift toward par.

Subordination of Future Debt: Restricts additional borrowing. Dividend Restrictions: Limits on dividends to protect bondholders. Collateralized Bonds: Safer than debentures. 6.7 Credit Default Swaps (CDS) A CDS is a contract that transfers the credit risk of a bond to another party. CDS Premium: Depends on the probability of bankruptcy and the recovery rate. \\[ \\begin{align} CDS \\ Premium &amp;= (1 - Recovery \\ Rate) \\times Probability \\ of \\ Default \\end{align} \\] Example: A pension fund hedging default risk with a one-year CDS on a corporate bond.

Factors affecting yield curve shape and deriving forward rates from the yield curve. 7.1.2 Bond Pricing Models 7.1.2.1 Bond Pricing Model I The price of a bond is the present value of expected cash flows, including coupon and principal.

It’s crucial to understand forward rates, zero rates, and actual rates. 7.1.3.1 Forward Rate Calculation Forward rates can be derived from zero rates to determine arbitrage-free pricing. \\[ \\begin{align} f_{n,n+1} &amp;= \\left( \\frac{(1 + z_{n+1})^{n+1}}{(1 + z_n)^n} \\right) - 1 \\end{align} \\] 7.1.4 Term Structure of Interest Rates (TSIR) TSIR describes the relationship between interest rates and terms. The yield curve can be influenced by: Expectations Hypothesis: Investors’ expectations about future interest rates. Liquidity Preference Theory: Prefers short-term bonds for liquidity purposes. Market Segmentation Theory: Different investors have different preferred investment horizons. Preferred Habitat Theory: Investors have preferred investment horizons but will deviate for adequate compensation. 7.1.5 Valuation of Coupon-Bearing Bonds To value coupon-bearing bonds, sum the present value of future cash flows (coupons and face value) discounted by the yield to maturity. \\[ \\begin{align} P &amp;= \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{C}{(1 + YTM)^t} + \\frac{F}{(1 + YTM)^T} \\end{align} \\] 7.1.6 Immunization Immunization strategies balance exposure to interest rate movements and reinvestment risk. Duration matching is a common immunization strategy. \\[ \\begin{align} D &amp;= \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{t \\cdot PV(C_t)}{P} \\end{align} \\] Where: - \\(D\\) = duration - \\(PV(C_t)\\) = present value of coupon at time \\(t\\) 7.1.7 Convexity Convexity measures the sensitivity of the duration of a bond to changes in interest rates. Bonds with higher convexity are less affected by rate changes. \\[ \\begin{align} Convexity &amp;= \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{t (t + 1) \\cdot PV(C_t)}{(1 + YTM)^{t+2}} \\end{align} \\] 7.1.8 Conclusion Understanding bond pricing, valuation, and the factors affecting the yield curve is crucial for fixed-income investment.

Performance Appraisal: Evaluate the overall performance of the portfolio. Performance Attribution: Determine the portion of performance due to the manager’s skill in selecting securities. 8.1.3 Performance Measurement Challenges include: - Mismatched cash flows and measurement frequency. - Multiple cash inflows and outflows (e.g., dividends, distributions, new funds). - Choice of measurement methodology (Time-weighted vs. Dollar-weighted). 8.1.3.1 Examples Example 1 &amp; 2: Calculating rate of return for one stock held over one period without dividends. Example 3 &amp; 4: Calculating the rate of return in continuous time and with dividends. Example 5: Holding one stock for multiple periods without dividends, calculating arithmetic and logarithmic rates of return. Example 6: Holding one stock for multiple periods with reinvested dividends, calculating time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return. Example 7: Managing an open-ended fund with multiple stocks, dividends, distributions, and new fund inflows, measuring time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return. 8.1.4 Performance Appraisal The fundamental question is whether the portfolio’s return of x% is good or bad, compared to an opportunity cost with the same risk. 8.1.4.1 Causes of Abnormal Performance Asset Allocation. Market Timing. Security Selection. Random influences (luck). 8.1.5 Performance Appraisal Measures Simple Benchmark Index: Compare portfolio performance to a benchmark index with the same risk. Sharpe Ratio: Measures excess return per unit of total risk. Treynor Ratio: Measures excess return per unit of non-diversifiable risk. Jensen’s Alpha: Based on CAPM, measures abnormal performance. Information Ratio: Measures abnormal return per unit of risk (active return-to-risk ratio). M^2 Measure: Compares a new portfolio combining P and the risk-free asset to the market portfolio. 8.1.6 Conclusion Effective performance appraisal requires understanding and utilizing various metrics and methods to evaluate and attribute portfolio performance accurately, considering both risk and return[1].
