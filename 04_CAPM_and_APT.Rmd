# CAPM and APT {#ch4}

- Estimate security risk premiums using capital market theory.
- Construct and use the security market line (SML).
- Specify and use a multifactor SML.
- Use Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) with multiple factors to identify mis-priced securities.

## The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The Markowitz portfolio selection model assumes all investors are rational, i.e., mean-variance optimizers.

CAPM assumes:

- Individual investors are price takers.
- All investors have a single-period planning horizon.
- No taxes or transaction costs.
- Information is costless and available to all investors.
- Investors interpret information identically.

### CAPM Equation

- The market portfolio defines the optimal Capital Allocation Line (CAL). In theory everyone tries to reach it. 

- Risk premium on the market portfolio is proportional to its risk and average risk aversion.


$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)
$$

where:

- $E(R_i)$ = expected return of investment
- $R_f$ = risk-free rate
- $\beta_i$ = beta of the investment
- $E(R_m) - R_f$ = market risk premium

Investors expect to be compensated for the risk and the time value of money.

For example, in NZ, BKMB is the risk free rate(note it is technically not) and additional basis point on top is the premium. 

$$
E(r_M) - r_f = \bar{A} \sigma_M^2
$$

$$
E(r_i) - r_f = \beta_i [E(r_M) - r_f]
$$

Here, $\bar{A}$ is the average level of risk aversion across investors (weighted average, by wealth).

and 

$$
\beta_i = \frac{\text{cov}(r_i, r_M)}{\sigma_M^2} = \frac{\rho_{i,M} \sigma_i}{\sigma_M}
$$

The CAPM calculates the expected return of an investment by adding the risk-free rate to the **beta**-adjusted market risk premium, where beta measures the investment's sensitivity to market risk and **alpha** represents the excess return not explained by beta.

### Security Market Line (SML)
- Graphs individual asset risk premiums as a function of asset risk (beta).
- Provides a benchmark for evaluating portfolio performance.

### CAPM Implementation
- Risk-free rate: Use short-term treasury securities.
- Beta: Covariance of stock and market returns divided by market variance.
- Market portfolio: Use a broad market index return.

### Violations and Limitations of the CAPM
- Empirical tests show a weaker relation between beta and returns.
- Market capitalization and book-to-market ratios predict returns better than beta.
- Other anomalies include momentum effects.

### Multifactor Models
- Allow for multiple systematic risk factors (e.g., GDP, inflation).
- Estimate a beta for each factor using multiple regression.

Example: Fama-French Three-Factor Model

- Factors: Market risk, firm size, and book-to-market ratio.

$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_{iM} (E(R_M) - R_f) + \beta_{iS} (E(SMB)) + \beta_{iH} (E(HML))
$$

- $\beta_{iM}$, $\beta_{iS}$, and $\beta_{iH}$ are the betas for the market, size, and value factors.

## Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

If two portfolios are mispriced, the investor could short the high-priced portfolio and buy the low-priced portfolio.

Arbitrage opportunities last for very short periods .

### Assumptions
- Returns can be described by a factor model.
- **No arbitrage opportunities.**
- Large number of securities to form diversified portfolios.

Like the CAPM, the APT also uses an SML for expected return and risk

### Key Concepts
- Systematic (factor) risk remains in diversified portfolios.
- Risk premium depends only on systematic risk.

### APT Model

**Portfolio A**
Portfolio A is a well-diversified portfolio with a beta ($\beta_P$) of 0.7. Its excess return equation is:

$$
\begin{align}
r_P - r_f &= \alpha_P + \beta_P (r_M - r_f) \\
          &= \alpha_P + 0.7(r_M - r_f)
\end{align}
$$

**Portfolio B**
Portfolio B includes the market index and T-bills with weights of 0.7 and 0.3 respectively. Its return equation is:

$$
\begin{align}
r_p &= 0.3r_f + 0.7r_M \\
    &= r_f + 0.7(r_M - r_f)
\end{align}
$$

By shorting \$1 of Portfolio A and buying \$1 of Portfolio B, you create a zero investment, zero beta portfolio. The proceeds would be riskless.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Proceeds} &= \text{Return from Portfolio B} - \text{Return from Portfolio A} \\
                &= r_B - r_P \\
                &= \left( r_f + 0.7(r_M - r_f) \right) - \left( r_f + \alpha_P + 0.7(r_M - r_f) \right) \\
                &= -\alpha_P
\end{align}
$$

- For a well-diversified portfolio $A$:

$$
E(R_A) = R_f + \sum_{j=1}^{k} \beta_{Aj} \lambda_j
$$

- $\beta_{Aj}$ is the sensitivity of portfolio $A$ to factor $j$.
- $\lambda_j$ is the risk premium associated with factor $j$.

$$ \lambda_j= \beta_1 [E(r_{M1}) - r_f]$$

### Multifactor Generalization
- Accommodates multiple risk factors.

$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_{i1} \lambda_1 + \beta_{i2} \lambda_2 + \ldots + \beta_{ik} \lambda_k
$$


### APT Pros and Cons

| **Strengths**                           | **Weaknesses**                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| reasonable description of risk and return   | Complex and difficult to measure        |
| Reflects various macroeconomic impacts  | world of winner chicken dinner, loser loses |
| Customizable to specific markets        | Requires extensive data                 |
| no need to measure market return directly | Dependent on accurate factor identification |

### APT v.s. CAPM

APT is more general in that it gets to an expected return and beta relationship without the assumption of the market portfolio
