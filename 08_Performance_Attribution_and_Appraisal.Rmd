# Performance Attribution and Appraisal {#ch8}

## Summary of Lecture 8: Performance Attribution and Appraisal

### Learning Objectives
The lecture aims to equip students with skills to:
- Compute raw and risk-adjusted rates of return.
- Evaluate investment performance.
- Apply style analysis to assess portfolio strategy.
- Decompose portfolio returns into asset allocation and security selection components.
- Assess market-timing ability.

### Steps in Performance Evaluation
1. **Performance Measurement**:
   - Calculate the return achieved by a portfolio over time.
2. **Performance Appraisal**:
   - Evaluate the overall performance of the portfolio.
3. **Performance Attribution**:
   - Determine the portion of performance due to the manager’s skill in selecting securities.

### Performance Measurement
Challenges include:
- Mismatched cash flows and measurement frequency.
- Multiple cash inflows and outflows (e.g., dividends, distributions, new funds).
- Choice of measurement methodology (Time-weighted vs. Dollar-weighted).

#### Examples
- **Example 1 & 2**: Calculating rate of return for one stock held over one period without dividends.
- **Example 3 & 4**: Calculating the rate of return in continuous time and with dividends.
- **Example 5**: Holding one stock for multiple periods without dividends, calculating arithmetic and logarithmic rates of return.
- **Example 6**: Holding one stock for multiple periods with reinvested dividends, calculating time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return.
- **Example 7**: Managing an open-ended fund with multiple stocks, dividends, distributions, and new fund inflows, measuring time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return.

### Performance Appraisal
The fundamental question is whether the portfolio's return of x% is good or bad, compared to an opportunity cost with the same risk.

#### Causes of Abnormal Performance
- Asset Allocation.
- Market Timing.
- Security Selection.
- Random influences (luck).

### Performance Appraisal Measures
1. **Simple Benchmark Index**:
   - Compare portfolio performance to a benchmark index with the same risk.
2. **Sharpe Ratio**:
   - Measures excess return per unit of total risk.
3. **Treynor Ratio**:
   - Measures excess return per unit of non-diversifiable risk.
4. **Jensen’s Alpha**:
   - Based on CAPM, measures abnormal performance.
5. **Information Ratio**:
   - Measures abnormal return per unit of risk (active return-to-risk ratio).
6. **M^2 Measure**:
   - Compares a new portfolio combining P and the risk-free asset to the market portfolio.

### Conclusion
Effective performance appraisal requires understanding and utilizing various metrics and methods to evaluate and attribute portfolio performance accurately, considering both risk and return`[1]`.
