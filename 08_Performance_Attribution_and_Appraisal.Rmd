# Performance Attribution and Appraisal {#ch8}

## Summary of Lecture 8: Performance Attribution and Appraisal

### Learning Objectives

The lecture aims to equip students with skills to:

- Compute raw and risk-adjusted rates of return.
- Evaluate investment performance.
- Apply style analysis to assess portfolio strategy.
- Decompose portfolio returns into asset allocation and security selection components.
- Assess market-timing ability.

### Steps in Performance Evaluation

1. **Performance Measurement**:
   - Calculate the return achieved by a portfolio over time.
2. **Performance Appraisal**:
   - Evaluate the overall performance of the portfolio.
3. **Performance Attribution**:
   - Determine the portion of performance due to the managerâ€™s skill in selecting securities.

### Performance Measurement

Challenges include:

- Mismatched cash flows and measurement frequency.
- Multiple cash inflows and outflows (e.g., dividends, distributions, new funds).
- Choice of measurement methodology (Time-weighted vs. Dollar-weighted).

### Performance Appraisal

The fundamental question is whether the portfolio's return of x% is good or bad, compared to an opportunity cost with the same risk.

#### Causes of Abnormal Performance

- Asset Allocation.
- Market Timing.
- Security Selection.
- Random influences (luck).

### Performance Appraisal Measures

#### Simple Benchmark Index

**Equation**: $$\text{Difference} = R_P - R_B$$

**Explanation**: Compares the portfolio return to the benchmark return.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Easy to calculate and understand. | Does not account for risk differences. |
| Provides a direct comparison to a relevant benchmark. | |

#### Sharpe Ratio

**Equation**: $$S = \frac{R_P - R_f}{\sigma_P}$$

**Explanation**: Measures the excess return per unit of total risk (standard deviation).

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Considers total risk (volatility). | Assumes returns are normally distributed. |
| Easy to interpret as a higher ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. | Does not differentiate between systematic and unsystematic risk. |

#### Treynor Ratio

**Equation**: $$T = \frac{R_P - R_f}{\beta_P}$$

**Explanation**: Measures the excess return per unit of non-diversifiable risk (beta).

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Focuses on systematic risk, which is relevant for well-diversified portfolios. | Requires an accurate estimation of beta. |
| Useful for comparing portfolios with different levels of market risk. | |

#### Jensen's Alpha

**Equation**: $$\alpha = R_P - \left( R_f + \beta_P (R_M - R_f) \right)$$

**Explanation**: Measures the abnormal return above the expected return predicted by the CAPM.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Indicates the value added by the portfolio manager. | Assumes CAPM holds true. |
| Helps in identifying skill in generating excess returns. | Requires accurate estimation of beta and market return. |

#### Information Ratio

**Equation**: $$IR = \frac{R_P - R_B}{\sigma_\alpha}$$

**Explanation**: Measures the abnormal return per unit of risk relative to a benchmark.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Considers the consistency of excess returns. | Requires a relevant benchmark for comparison. |
| Useful for evaluating active management. | Tracking error (risk) can be difficult to estimate. |

#### M^2 Measure

**Equation**: $$M^2 = R_f + \frac{R_P - R_f}{\sigma_P} \cdot \sigma_M$$

**Explanation**: Compares the performance of a portfolio adjusted to have the same total risk as the market portfolio.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Provides an intuitive comparison to the market portfolio. | Assumes the market portfolio is the appropriate benchmark. |
| Transforms Sharpe Ratio into a measure comparable to market returns. | |


### Conclusion

Effective performance appraisal requires understanding and utilizing various metrics and methods to evaluate and attribute portfolio performance accurately, considering both risk and return`[1]`.
